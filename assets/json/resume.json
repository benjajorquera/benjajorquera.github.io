There is no standardized protocol for assessing it, leading to various modeling approaches. This study explores using particle swarm optimization (PSO) to improve model selection, comparing it with traditional methods. It focused on FIR and ARX models, both linear and nonlinear. PSO performed well, especially with ARX models, improving search time and yielding results similar to exhaustive searches."}],"skills":[{"name":"Languages & Development","level":"","icon":"fa-solid fa-hashtag","keywords":["C/C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript","Ruby On Rails, SQL, MongoDB","React, Vue.js, Node.js, .NET","HTML/CSS, Webpack, Jest, Vite/Vitest, Babel, AWS"]},{"name":"Data Science","level":"","icon":"fa-solid fa-hashtag","keywords":["R, RStudio, Python","Jupyter Notebooks"]},{"name":"Technologies","level":"","icon":"fa-solid fa-hashtag","keywords":["GitHub, Robo3T","Postman, Target Process","Bitbucket, Figma, Dynatrace","SonarQube"]},{"name":"Additional Experience","level":"","icon":"fa-solid fa-hashtag","keywords":["Part-time Waiter at an Italian Restaurant","Retail Sales at Detogni and Ripley"]}],"languages":[{"language":"Spanish","fluency":"Native speaker","icon":""},{"language":"English","fluency":"Intermediate/Advanced","icon":""}],"interests":[{"name":"Hobbies","icon":"fa-solid fa-tag","keywords":["Videogames","Books","Sports"]}],"references":[{"name":"Sebastian Rozas (+569 76180286)","icon":"fa-solid fa-laptop","reference":"Seba is Product Owner (or Product Manager) of Cuprum Advice team, I have been working with him for more than a year, we have developed a great variety of projects together."}],"projects":[{"name":"Interpino App","summary":"InterPino is a local desktop application designed for the Patient Management Unit at El Pino Hospital.
